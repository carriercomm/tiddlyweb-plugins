a customisable atom feed

*** allows customisations ***
An AtomViewTemplate tiddler was considered, however introducing such a mechanism would have created a wealth of problems including invalid w3c markup, an rss item inside an atom feed? Treating bags differently would have required multiple atom template tiddlers which would have been a pain to manage. The simplest solution seemed to be the AtomSettings tiddler (Easy to parse and hopefully readable)


*** provides enriched atom feeds ***
The new version is geo friendly - mapping the tiddler fields geo.lat and geo.long to valid atom feed tags.
